            [Intro]
                       Bm
            I got your picture
            I'm coming with you
                   G
            Dear Maria, count me in
                       D
            There's a story at the bottom 
                    A
            of this bottle and I'm the pen

            [Interlude]
            G--A--D--F#m

            [Verse 1]
            D
              When the lights go off
                    G
            I wanna watch the way you 
                               Em
            take the stage by storm
            The way you wrap those
                  A
            boys around your finger
                      G        D
            Go on and play the leader
            Cause you know it's
                        G
            what you're good at
                                 Em
            The low road for the fast track
                              A   F#/Bb
            Make every second last

            [Chorus]
                       Bm
            I got your picture
            I'm coming with you
                   G
            Dear Maria, count me in
                       D
            There's a story at the bottom 
                    A
            of this bottle and I'm the pen
                    Bm
            Make it count when I'm the 
                      G
            one who's selling you out
                     D
            Cause it feels like stealing hearts
                         A
            Calling your name from the crowd

            [Interlude]
            G--A--D--F#m

            [Verse 2]
                         D
            Live and let live
            You'll be the showgirl
                   G
            of the home team
                           Em
            I'll be the narrator
                     A
            Telling another tale 
            of the American dream
            D N.C.
              I see your name in lights
            G
              We could make you a star
            Em
            Girl, we'll take the 
            world by storm
               A              F#/Bb
            It isn't that hard

            [Chorus]
                       Bm
            I got your picture
            I'm coming with you
                   G
            Dear Maria, count me in
                       D

            Make it count when I'm the 
                      G
            one who's selling you out
                     D
            Cause it feels like stealing hearts
                         A
            Calling your name from the crowd

            [Solo]
            D---A-F#m-G--G--A (x2)

            [Bridge]

            Take a breath
                     A        F#m
            Don't it sound so easy?
            G
            Never had a doubt
                    G     A
            Now I'm going crazy 
            D        A    F#m G    G-A
            watching from the floor
            D
              Take a breath and let 
                A         F#m
            the rest come easy
            G
            Never settle down
                      G
            Cause the cash flow 
            A         D      A  F#m  G
            leaves me always wanting more

            [Chorus]
                           Bm N.C.
            Coz I got your picture
            I'm coming with you
