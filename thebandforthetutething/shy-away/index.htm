            [Intro]
            F   Am   G
            Em  C   G/B

            [Verse 1]
                   F
            When I get home
            Am                G
            You better not be there
                          Em
            We're placin' bets you won't

            [Pre-Chorus]
            C         G/B      F
            Shed your modesty
                         Am               G
            And the only thing to leave behind
                        Em          C     G/B
            Is your own skin on the floor


            [Chorus]
                      F
            Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
            Dm
            Manifest a ceiling
                     Am
            When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
            G/B                G
            Searchin' for that feelin'
                          F
            Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
                 Dm
            That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
                   Am                          G/B              G
            Like a song he wrote, that's never heard (Ah-ah-ah)

            Don't you (Ssh)


            [Verse 2]
                     F
            When you get home
                Am          G
            You barely recognize the pictures
            Em
            They put in a frame


            [Pre-Chorus 2]
                       C         G/B
            'Cause you shed your modesty
            F                Dm
            Don't circle the track
                          Am
            Take what you have
                                       G/B
            And leave your skin on the floor

            [Chorus]
                      F
            Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
            Dm
            Manifest a ceiling
                     Am
            When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
            G/B                G
            Searchin' for that feelin'
                          F
            Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
                 Dm
            That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
                   Am                          G/B              G
            Like a song he wrote, that's never heard (Ah-ah-ah)


            [Verse 3]
                   F
            When I get home
            Dm
            Boy, you better not be there
            Am
            You're long gone


            [Pre-Chorus 3]
                G/B       G
            You shed your modesty
            F                Dm
            Don't circle the track
                                    Am
            Just break the cycle in half
                                       G/B    G
            And leave your skin on the floor

            [Chorus]
                      F
            Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)

            Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)

            That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
                   Am                          G/B
            Like a song he wrote, that's never heard (Ah-ah-ah)
                         F            Dm        Am   G/B   G
            That's never heard (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)


            [Outro]
            Am
            An "I love you"
            Am
            That isn't words
                   Am
            Like a song he wrote
                         G/B
            That's never heard
                      F         Dm    Am   G/B   G
            Don't you shy away
